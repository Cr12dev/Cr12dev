# 👋 Hi! Developer
**Hi, I'm Cr12Dev, a fullstack developer with over 4 years of experience.**
I specialize in web development using popular frameworks and mobile applications with Kotlin and Expo. <br/><br/>

## My Stack
### Web development
 - **NESTJS**: To create the entire backend of my application, in addition to creating REST APIs.
 - **NextJS**: I use it to create the frontend and design the entire web application.
 - **Prisma**: Where I create the entire schema for a future database (PostgreSQL & Supabase)
### Mobile development
- **Expo**: I create the entire frontend there, and for the backend I use NestJS.
- **Kotlin**: It helps me when I use Expo for some things that can't be reached.
